## LeetCode

This repo contains my solutions for LeetCode problems. Feel free to use them as a reference. I will try to keep this repo updated as I solve more problems.

### Folder Structure

There are three folders: easy, medium, and hard. Each folder contains problems in that level.
So the structure is as follows:

```
├── easy
│   ├── 1-problem-name.js
│   ├── 2-problem-name.js
│   └── ...
├── medium
│   ├── 1-problem-name.js
│   ├── 2-problem-name.js
│   └── ...
└── hard
    ├── 1-problem-name.js
    ├── 2-problem-name.js
    └── ...
```

### How to run

Each file is a solution to a problem. To run a solution, simply run the file with node.

```bash
node easy/1-problem-name.js
```

### How to contribute

If you have a better solution to a problem, feel free to submit a PR. I will review it and merge it if it is better than the current solution.
